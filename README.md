## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

To explore any project in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrahmanashiq/vue-101.git
   cd vue-101
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific project:**
   ```bash
   cd eduhub-lms/phase-1-basics
   ```

3. **Open in browser or serve locally:**
   - For basic HTML files: Open `index.html` in your browser
   - For Vue CLI projects: Run `npm install` then `npm run serve`

## 📝 Learning Notes

### Key Concepts Learned
- **Declarative Rendering:** Vue.js uses a template syntax to declaratively render data
- **Component System:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Reactive Data:** Vue automatically tracks dependencies and updates the DOM efficiently
- **Directives:** Special attributes that apply reactive behavior to rendered DOM

### Best Practices Adopted
- Using meaningful component names
- Keeping components small and focused
- Following Vue.js style guide conventions
- Writing clean, readable code with proper commenting
